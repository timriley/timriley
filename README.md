### Hi there! 👋🏼

Hi! [I’m Tim](https://timriley.info/). I love Ruby. I’ve worked with Ruby for over 20 years, and even after all this time, it still brings me joy!

**My mission in open source is to ensure the joy of Ruby extends to the experience of writing real, maintainable applications, for teams of all sizes.**

🌸 Find my work in the [**Hanami**](https://hanamirb.org), [**Dry**](https://dry-rb.org) and [**Rom**](https://rom-rb.org) projects. [**You can sponsor me via Hanami!**](https://sponsor.hanamirb.org/) 

After a decade of building over nights and weekends, I am now committing a full 1 day/week to Ruby open source. Your kind support will help sustain me in these efforts. Thank you!

To see what I’ve been up to recently, check out [my blog](https://timriley.info/).
