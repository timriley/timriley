### Hi there! üëãüèº

Hi! [I‚Äôm Tim](https://timriley.info/). I love Ruby. I've worked with Ruby for over 20 years, and even after all this time, it still brings me joy!

**My mission in open source is to ensure the joy of Ruby extends to the experience of writing real, maintainable applications, for teams of all sizes.**

For me, this comes from following a hybrid FP/OOP approach to writing Ruby, and for the last 6+ years, I‚Äôve  been helping to build tools to make this easy for application developers.

I‚Äôm a co-founder and core team member of the [**dry-rb**](https://dry-rb.org) project, and a core team member of the [**rom-rb**](https://rom-rb.org) and [**Hanami**](https://hanamirb.org) projects.

Right now, I‚Äôm heavily involved in the effort to build **Hanami v2**, which represents a new model for Ruby open source collaboration, and will provide a true  _framework of the future_ for Ruby application developers.

[**You can ‚ù§Ô∏è sponsor me on GitHub**](https://github.com/sponsors/timriley). I do the majority of my open source work as my ‚Äúsecond job,‚Äù on nights and weekends, and your kind support will help sustain me in all of these efforts. Thank you! üôèüèº

### Current status üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

Currently (October 2023): We‚Äôre gearing up to release Hanami 2.1.0.
