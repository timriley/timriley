### Hi there! 👋🏼

Hi! [I'm Tim](https://timriley.info/). I love Ruby. I've worked with Ruby for nearly 20 years, and even after all this time, it still brings me joy!

**My mission in open source is to ensure the joy of Ruby extends to the experience of writing real, maintainable applications, for teams of all sizes.**

For me, this comes from following a hybrid FP/OOP approach to writing Ruby, and for the last 6+ years, I’ve  been helping to build tools to make this easy for application developers.

I’m a co-founder and core team member of the [**dry-rb**](https://dry-rb.org) project, and a core team member of the [**rom-rb**](https://rom-rb.org) and [**Hanami**](https://hanamirb.org) projects.

Right now, I’m heavily involved in the effort to build **Hanami 2.0**, which represents a new model for Ruby open source collaboration, and will provide a true  _framework of the future_ for Ruby application developers.

[**You can ❤️ sponsor me on GitHub**](https://github.com/sponsors/timriley). I do the majority of my open source work as my “second job,” on nights and weekends, and your kind support will help sustain me in all of these efforts. Thank you! 🙏🏼

### Current status 👨🏻‍💻

Currently, I'm:

- Integrating actions and views into Hanami 2.0 (watch for PRs in [hanami/hanami](https://github.com/hanami/hanami), [hanami/view](https://github.com/hanami/view) and [hanami/controller](https://github.com/hanami/controller))
- Planning for the remaining work before we ship Hanami 2.0.0.alpha2
